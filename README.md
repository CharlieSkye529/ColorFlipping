# ColorFlipping
a game similar to card flipping,you need to change a square's color many times so that all squares are the same color
the whole game is only made by Python and its Turtle module, which means that it's a GUI

here are rules:
first:here are 25 squares,you can choose one at a time,and below the screen is a color set,which owns five colors you can choose to change the square

second:If a square is surrounded by squares of the same color, their colors will change together,"surrounded" means the up, down, left and right of the square.One thing you should know that if around the square there are other squares of the same color,they also change together

third:if all squares are the same color at last,you win this game,but the watches won't be closed.
